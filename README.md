# PlotPointGraph-With-Screenshot

This is a graph created in HTML and CSS. The graph has seven dropdown boxes for each other labels on the graph. 
The drop down contains numbers going from 0-100 in increments of 5 (these represent millimetres of rain on that day).
Change the value in the dropdown also changes the position of the dot on the graph for the corresponding day.
Each dot is connected to each other but a line using the Draw funtion in the JavaScript file.
A title can also be added to the graph. 
You can save the graph, this takes a screenshot of the graph and displays it in the viewing area below the graph. 
You cna scroll through the saved images and click on them to enlarge, an exit button is included to back out of the enlarged image.
